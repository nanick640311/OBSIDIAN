Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones in less than six weeks, a loss of aircraft worth more than $200 million in what is becoming the most dramatic cost to the Pentagon of the military campaign against the [Iran-backed militants.](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/04/17/us-forces-strike-yemen-oil-port-in-ongoing-campaign-against-houthis/ "https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/04/17/us-forces-strike-yemen-oil-port-in-ongoing-campaign-against-houthis/")

According to defense officials, three of the drones were shot down in the past week — suggesting the militants’ targeting of the unmanned aircraft flying over Yemen has improved. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. has [increased its attacks on the Houthis,](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/03/17/us-strikes-dozens-of-houthi-sites-in-yemen-as-broader-campaign-begins/ "https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/03/17/us-strikes-dozens-of-houthi-sites-in-yemen-as-broader-campaign-begins/") launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Central Command spokesman Dave Eastburn said Thursday night that the U.S. has struck more than 800 Houthi targets. “These strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, advanced weapons storage locations, and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,” Eastburn said.

Another defense official said that although hostile fire is likely the cause of the drone losses, the incidents are still under investigation. The official noted that the increase in U.S. strikes can add to the risk to aircraft, but said the U.S. will take every measure possible to protect troops, equipment and interests in the region. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to comment on sensitive military issues.

The sophisticated drones, built by General Atomics, cost about $30 million each, and generally fly at altitudes of more than 40,000 feet. Houthis leaders have consistently touted the strikes in public statements. One of the defense officials said the U.S. lost Reaper drones on March 31 and on April 3, 9, 13, 18, 19 and 22.

U.S. senators, meanwhile, are raising concerns about civilian casualties caused by the American strikes in Yemen. Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia wrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday questioning whether the Trump administration is “abandoning the measures necessary to meet its obligations to reducing civilian harm.”

Specifically, they questioned reports that U.S. strikes at the Ras Isa fuel terminal in Yemen last week potentially killed more than 70 civilians.

“Military leaders agree that ingraining civilian harm mitigation practices within U.S operations leads to better outcomes and that civilian casualties actually undermine the mission that the military has been sent in to do,” their letter said.

In addition to downing the drones, the Houthis have been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. They haven’t hit any.

The U.S. has been using an array of warships, fighter jets, bombers and drones to strike the Houthis, and aircraft can now launch from two Navy carriers in the region.

Hegseth decided in March to beef up the Navy warship presence in the Middle East, ordering the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman to extend its deployment there, as the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson steamed toward the area.

The Truman, along with two of the destroyers and a cruiser in its strike group, is now in the Red Sea. And the Vinson, along with two destroyers and a cruiser, is in the Gulf of Aden.

The third destroyer assigned to the Truman is in the Mediterranean Sea. And two other U.S. Navy destroyers are in the Red Sea, but aren’t part of the Truman’s group.

Hegseth is weighing whether to grant a request by U.S. Central Command to once again extend the Truman’s deployment. A decision to do that could keep the Truman and at least some of its strike group in the region for several more weeks.

It has been rare in recent years for the U.S. to have two aircraft carriers in the Middle East at the same time. Navy leaders have generally been opposed to the idea because it disrupts ship maintenance schedules and delays time at home for sailors strained by the unusually high combat tempo.

Last year, the Biden administration ordered the [aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2025/04/15/uss-carl-vinson-in-mideast-ahead-of-iran-us-nuclear-talks/ "https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2025/04/15/uss-carl-vinson-in-mideast-ahead-of-iran-us-nuclear-talks/") to remain in the Red Sea for an extended time, as U.S. warships waged the [most intense running sea battle](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/06/16/navy-faces-most-intense-running-sea-battle-since-wwii-with-houthis/ "https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/06/16/navy-faces-most-intense-running-sea-battle-since-wwii-with-houthis/") since World War II.

Prior to that, it had been years since the U.S. had committed that much warship power to the Middle East.

The Houthis have been waging [persistent missile and drone attacks](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/10/19/how-one-warship-thwarting-a-houthi-attack-a-year-ago-changed-the-navy/ "https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/10/19/how-one-warship-thwarting-a-houthi-attack-a-year-ago-changed-the-navy/") against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as an effort to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and [killing four civilian sailors.](https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba "https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba") That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.
