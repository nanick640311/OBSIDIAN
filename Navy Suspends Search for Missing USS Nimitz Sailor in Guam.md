The Navy suspended a five-day-long search today for a missing sailor from the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in Guam.

“The sailor has been listed as Duty Status Whereabouts Unknown after being reported unaccounted for Saturday morning while the USS *Nimitz* (CVN-68) was conducting a regularly scheduled port call at Naval Base Guam,” reads a Navy press release on the conclusion of the search.

Navy, Coast Guard and local authorities searched 11,000 nautical miles around Guam. Responding assets included Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 25, a P-8 maritime patrol aircraft Commander Task Force 72, USCGC *Oliver Henry* (WPC-1140), 45-foot long Response Boat-Mediums, and Guam Fire Rescue Teams.

“The sailor’s family has been notified, and their name is being withheld until 24 hours after next-of-kin notification is complete in accordance with Navy policy,” according to the release.

Guam authorities identified the missing sailor as Gabriel D. Holt, [according to local press reports](https://www.kuam.com/story/52713536/unresolved-incidents-on-guam-missing-sailor-unidentified-body-and-hospital).

In March, the 49-year-old Nimitz [left San Diego for its final deployment](https://news.usni.org/2025/03/26/uss-nimitz-leaves-san-diego-on-final-deployment). The nuclear-powered supercarrier is set to be decommissioned by next year. [Its stop in Guam was the first in the Indo-Pacific region since departing the West Coast.](https://news.usni.org/2025/04/20/uss-nimitz-in-guam-for-port-visit-u-s-south-korea-wrap-mine-warfare-exercise)

Alongside Nimitz, Carrier Air Wing 17, USS *Curtis Wilbur* (DDG-54), USS *Gridley* (DDG-101), USS *Wayne E. Meyer* (DDG-108) and USS *Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee* (DDG-123) compose the strike group.
