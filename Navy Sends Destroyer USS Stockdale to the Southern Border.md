A guided-missile destroyer was dispatched to patrol the Eastern Pacific on Friday, the Navy announced.

USS *Stockdale* (DDG-106) left Naval Base San Diego, Calif., on Friday with an embarked Coast Guard law enforcement detachment.

The patrol is part of U.S. Northern Command’s efforts in tandem with the Department of Homeland Security focus on the U.S. southern border.

“ *Stockdale’s* sea-going capacity contributes to USNORTHCOM’s ability to protect the United States’ territorial integrity, sovereignty, and security, through a coordinated, multi-domain strategy,” reads a U.S. Navy Statement.  
“ *Stockdale* will continue operations with an embarked U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET). These Coast Guard teams bring specialized expertise in maritime interdiction, enabling the ship to address a range of challenges, from countering illegal activities to supporting humanitarian efforts and homeland security operations.”

Last month, U.S. Fleet Forces Commander Adm. Daryl Caudle said U.S. ships operating in the Pacific in support of NORTHCOM’s mission would focus on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“But you can think of operations in the Gulf of America being a predominant part of \[southern border enforcement\] for the East Coast ship, and then on the West Coast ship, you can think of the area in and around the San Diego area, and that traffic area coming in between Mexico and the United States,” Caudle said.

*Stockdale*, which deployed with the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the Pacific and Middle East, is replacing guided-missile destroyer USS *Spruance* (DDG-111), which deployed from San Diego on March 22. USS *Gravely* (DDG-107) deployed from Norfolk, Va., on the East Coast.

*Spruance* helped rescue 18 people from a disabled vessel 50 miles offshore, among other operations.
