USS *Iowa* (SSN-797), the 24th submarine of the Virginia-class, was commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, on Saturday.

The 7,800-ton nuclear attack boat is at least the fifth ship named for the state in American naval service, and follows in the steps of two battleships that saw service in the World Wars and Korea. The last *Iowa* was BB-61, the lead hull in the four-ship World War II Iowa-class.

Present at the event, alongside congressional members and fleet leadership, was John Phelan in his first commissioning ceremony as the 79th Secretary of the Navy.

In his remarks, Phelan emphasized deterrence and the crucial role of submarines in modern naval warfare.

“Make no mistake, naval warfare is evolving. Where battleships once ruled the seas, it is the silent strength of submarines that provides our Navy with an unmatched strategic advantage. The role of submarines in modern warfare is not just about strength; it’s about deterrence,” said Phelan during the commissioning ceremony.

Ordered in 2014, laid down in 2019, christened in 2023 and delivered to the Navy in 2024, the submarine is the latest from the Virginia-class and the 13th built by General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII Newport News to join the fleet. Built largely during the COVID-19 pandemic, EB president Mark Rayha noted the challenges that had to be overcome during Iowa’s construction.

“We did not miss a day during COVID, and that is a testament to our shipbuilders. We endured a graving dock pontoon break; we also endured many other hardships during that period,” said Rayha.

Phelan said *Iowa’s* commissioning was “just the beginning” of an effort that the administration looks to undertake to revitalize American shipbuilding and the maritime industrial base.

“This is not just a milestone for USS *Iowa*, but a critical step forward in strengthening our navy and ensuring America’s global maritime dominance,” said Phelan

*Iowa* fields Tomahawk cruise missiles, Mk-48 torpedoes, and underwater-launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles via 12 vertical launching cells and four torpedo tubes.

“It’s what one worker said to me ‘a can of whoopass.’ It’s pretty impressive,” remarked Phelan.

Naval officials from AUKUS partners Australia and the United Kingdom also attended the commissioning. The Royal Australian Navy is slated to receive [three used Block IV Virginia-class submarines between 2032 and 2035](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3909275/us-partners-mark-third-year-of-aukus-partnership/) in the Pilar 1 effort as a stop-gap measure until the SSN-AUKUS, a new class of nuclear attack boat, comes online. An option to sell an additional two Virginias is on the table if plans fall behind schedule.

“Submarines ensure that no adversary can act with impunity, that our allies can rely on our strength and that peace is preserved through our unwavering readiness,” said Phelan.

With the rise of the Chinese fleet and other maritime threats, submarines have received increased focus from Congress and Navy leadership.

Overall, the Navy and industry are moving to expand the workforce and improve production of the Virginias and Columbia-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Both programs have suffered delays in delivery from issues ranging from workforce to supplier delivery delays.
