Aircraft Carrier USS *Nimitz* (CVN-68) made its first port call since departing [its Indo-Pacific deployment](https://news.usni.org/2025/03/26/uss-nimitz-leaves-san-diego-on-final-deployment), arriving in Guam on Friday with two of its escorts. Meanwhile the U.S. Navy and Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) wrapped up a mine warfare exercise in South Korean waters on last week.  
*Nimitz*, flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11, destroyers USS *Gridley* (DDG-101), USS *Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee* (DDG-123) arrived in Guam for a regularly scheduled port on Friday, according [to the service](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/495629/uss-nimitz-carrier-strike-group-arrives-guam)

“The Nimitz Carrier Strike Group’s arrival in Guam highlights the island’s vital role as a strategic outpost in the Western Pacific—essential for projecting power, deterring adversaries, and responding to crises across the Indo-Pacific,” said Rear Adm. Maximilian Clark, commander, Carrier Strike Group 11, in the release.  
“It’s always an honor to return to Guam—where our service members are welcomed like family, and where our presence truly matters. The Nimitz Strike Group is proud to be in Guam—America’s critical terrain and gateway to maintaining stability in the region.”

Destroyers USS *Curtis Wilbur* (DDG-54) and USS *Wayne E. Meyer* (DDG-108) also deployed out as part of the Nimitz CSG but during the transit of the Pacific Ocean, *Wayne E. Meyer* detached from the CSG, making a port visit to Singapore from [Mar. 26](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8945879/wayne-e-meyer-pulls-into-republic-singapore) to [Mar. 31](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8945890/wayne-e-meyer-departs-singapore) and headed to the U.S Central Command area of operations where it is now operating as [part of the Carl Vinson CSG](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8974415/uss-wayne-e-meyer-conducts-operations-us-central-command-area-responsibility-part-carl-vinson).

*Curtis Wilbur* meanwhile, has detached from the CSG to conduct a port visit to Saipan. News channel NMI News Service on Thursday posted a [video](https://www.facebook.com/NMINewsService/videos/651775574154479) showing *Curtis Wilbur* docking at Saipan that day. *Curtis Wilbur* is expected to rejoin the CSG as previous CSG visits to Guam had a destroyer from the CSG detaching and conducting a port visit to Saipan and subsequently rejoining the CSG.

During its transit of the Pacific Ocean, the Nimitz CSG consisting of *Nimitz*, *Curtis Wilbur*, *Gridley* and *Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee* carried out [a formation sail](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8966974/nimitz-carrier-strike-group-photoex) with cruiser USS *Michael Monsoor* (DDG-1001) and fleet oiler USNS *John Lewis* (T-AO-205) on Apr. 10. *Michael Monsoor* is on an independent deployment to the Indo-Pacific though the U.S. Navy has release little information on its deployment.

Earlier in Guam on Monday, fast-attack submarine USS *Minnesota* (SSN-783) returned to its homeport of Naval Base Guam following its first operational tasking while forward-deployed in the Indo-Pacific region, according to a navy [release](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/495318/uss-minnesota-returns-home-naval-base-guam), “This first operational tasking following Minnesota’s recent homeport shift demonstrated the submarine’s operational readiness and the capabilities the Virginia-class brings to the Indo-Pacific region,” said Capt. Neil Steinhagen, commander, Submarine Squadron 15, in the release.

The release stated that *Minnesota* ’s operations included a port visit to Western Australia, marking the first of two planned U.S. Virginia-class fast-attack submarine visits to HMAS Stirling in 2025. *Minnesota* also visited Darwin in Australia’s Northern Territory, supporting bilateral engagements and hosting tours for local officials, according to the release.

The release also stated that while in the region, the crew took part in at-sea operations as part of the Submarine Command Course and participated in Exercise Lungfish, a tactical development exercise between the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Navy, “Working side-by-side with our Australian counterparts helped sharpen our undersea warfighting skills. That kind of tactical development is vital—not just for increasing our own readiness, but for enhancing interoperability with allied warfighters deployed shoulder-to-shoulder in support of a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”, said Cmdr. Jeffrey Cornielle, commanding officer, *Minnesota*, in the release.

On Wednesday, U.S. Seventh Fleet flagship USS *Blue Ridge* (LCC-19) arrived in Cairns, Australia for a routine port visit, according to a Navy [release](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/495395/blue-ridge-conducts-port-call-cairns-australia), Deepest thanks to the people of Cairns for their warm welcome to our *Blue Ridge* and 7th Fleet teams,” said Vice Adm. Fred Kacher, commander, U.S. 7th Fleet, in the release, “The U.S. 7th Fleet operates closely every day with the Royal Australian Navy to advance our combined warfighting capabilities and keep the Indo-Pacific secure and prosperous, and we are grateful that the first port visit with our flagship is here in Australia.”

Cairns will serve as a short stop for *Blue Ridge* as the ship brings fuel and supplies on board, reads the release.
